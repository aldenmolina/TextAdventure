  storyText: "You have been working at a Japanese Hibachi restaurant as a kitchen
    helper for almost 4 months. A couple of the chefs walked out in a fit of rage
    for unknown reasons to you. Believed to be the next best thing, the manager decided
    that you would be the one to take over. Faced with the responsibility of cooking
    and entertaining the customers, you are faced with a dilemma. This is the first
    time you have been in this environment but you have observed the chefs before.
    \n\nYou are at your first table. What do you do first?\n1. Greet your customers.\n2.
    Look at the orders."
