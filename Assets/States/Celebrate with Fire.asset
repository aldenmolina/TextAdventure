  storyText: 'The job well done on the cooking gave you a confidence boost! You decide
    to celebrate with one final fire to end the show. As you light up the celebratory
    fire, you pointed the oil at the wrong angle and got it on your customer. It singed
    her dress, and you realize its her birthday too. She is now screaming up a storm
    requiring your managers presence. Bad luck. Be careful with your fire next time,
    buddy!
