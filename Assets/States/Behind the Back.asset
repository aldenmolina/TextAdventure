  storyText: "A regular flip doesn't dazzle them anymore. This time you do another
    flip, but you catch it from behind. You tossed it and reached your hand around
    to grab. There was too much strength in the toss and the flip. You knocked over
    a customer's drink. It was everywhere. What do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Apologize and
    clean it yourself.\r\n2. Yell for help."
