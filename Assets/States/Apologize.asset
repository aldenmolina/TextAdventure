  storyText: 'You apologized profusely and went to go and grab a towel to help clean
    the mess you made. By this time, the customers are in a bad mood. You made a big
    mess, they have been waiting a long time and you still haven''t started cooking.
    The customers are livid and decide to leave the restaurant on a negative note.
    You failed your first table. Maybe next time you''d be more cautious.


    Press "Q" to exit.'
