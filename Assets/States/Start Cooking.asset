  storyText: "You have no professional experience, but at least you are pretty confident
    with your cooking at home. You started cooking the fried rice. Its awkward but
    its not much of a difference. You're not sure who ordered the fried rice, nor
    do you have any bowls to put it in. So you decide to push it to the side for now
    in low heat. Now it comes the vegetables. Your first time making the onion volcano.\r\n\r\n1.
    Make the volcano\r\n2. Skip it and hope they don't notice."
