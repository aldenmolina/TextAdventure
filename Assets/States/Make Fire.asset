  storyText: "Oil and alcohol. The 2 key ingredients in making the symbolic fire in
    all Hibachi shows. You glazed the grill with the oil and grabbed the alcohol to
    light it up. As the fire started, you realized you added too much oil and the
    fire was way too big. You hear the customers scream. You panicked but realized
    all the customers were laughing and having a good time. They enjoyed the big fire
    you created. A job well done. What is your next move?\r\n\r\n1. Start cooking.\r\n2.
    Offer if anybody wants some sake."
